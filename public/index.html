    <h2>About Islam</h2>
    <p>Islam is one of the world’s major monotheistic religions, founded in the 7th century CE in Arabia by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It is the second-largest religion in the world, with over 1.9 billion followers, known as Muslims. Islam is based on belief in one God (Allah in Arabic) and follows a comprehensive system of life encompassing faith, law, and morality.</p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Islam</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>1. Belief in Allah (Tawhid):</h3></li>
      <li>In Islam, belief in Allah (Arabic for God) is the foundation of the faith, referred to as Tawhid, which means the absolute oneness and uniqueness of Allah. This concept is the most fundamental and central aspect of Islam and emphasizes that Allah is the sole creator, sustainer, and ruler of the universe.</li>
      <li><h3>2. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ :</h3></li>
      <li>Muhammad ﷺ "peace be upon him" (PBUH) is considered the final prophet in Islam. Muslims believe that Muhammad received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel over 23 years, which were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Qur’an.</li>
      <li><h3>3. The Qur’an:</h3></li>
      <li>The Quran is a language: Plural. You say: I read something as a Qur'an, if I put it together." Abu Ubaida said: The Qur'an is the word of God revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) for the miraculous revelation of a chapter of the Qur'an, and its recitation is obligatory. Al-Suyuti said: The Qur'an excludes the Torah, the Bible and all other divine books: By "revealed to Muhammad" we exclude the Torah, the Bible and all other heavenly books, and by "miraculous" we mean the divine (divine) hadiths, although the Qur'an was revealed to others as well, because it is what is needed in distinguishing between the words of God and the words of men. Our saying: "with a surah from it" is an indication of the least amount of miraculous occurrences.</li>
